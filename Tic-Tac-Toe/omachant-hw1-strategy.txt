Part I:
The New York Regents Science Test for fourth graders vs Turing Test:
Pros:

     1.	Machines that can pass the Science test are relatively easy to create than those that can pass the Turing test. Any machine that can search through a knowledge base quickly and efficiently can pass this test. 
     2.	The Science Test has questions that require deductions from graphs and pictures to correctly answer them.  Analyzing and connecting the dots between the picture and question shows a reasonable degree of intelligence. In that sense, a machine can be considered intelligent if it passes this test. 
     3.	Responses are more accurate because the rules can be designed in a way to answer these kind of questions.

Cons:

     1.	This is not enough proof of intelligence as compared to the Turing test. The Turing test is more conversational in nature which requires a level of common sense rather than trying to parse bunch of datasets. 
     2.	Large volumes of data has to be searched to answer accurately. Efficient rules that are generic in nature have to be designed.
     3.	Humans can answer any question on Turing Test while machines can’t. Thus Science Test does not check into this aspect of intelligence as done by the Turing Test.   

Part II:

Move Selection strategies:

1. X goes first irrespective of the player(machine/user)
2. If machine plays first, it begins by filling the center position first.
3. The user can begin either ways, but the next move by the machine will always be center.
4. If the user chose center position first, and a corner position in her subsequent move, to not let the user win the machine places it's move on the opposite corner.
5. The machine blocks the user in any case from getting three by checking similar/dissimilar values both row/column and diagonal wise.
6. If there are two ways to get a three, the machine choses one way depending on which if..else condition is satisfied first.
